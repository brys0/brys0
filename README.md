### Bio 🍁

Hi! I'm Brys i'm currently in highschool at age `16` I develop projects in the meantime such as Kyro (Mentioned Above). I currently work in Kotlin, Java, Javascript, Typescript, C#, and php. I'm learning more every chance I get! I don't really develop front end projects I more like backend style things more. However I also make logos and such. I live in the United states as well
